# APCSFinalProject
Candy Crush game - APCS Final for Mr. K's period 10 class. 

**Group Name**: Sweet Treats

**Members**: Steven Lei and Ava Lu

**Brief Description**: 
We will be creating a remake of the Candy Crush Saga game using Java and Processing. The game will offer ten levels of increasing difficulty and will incorporate obstacles such as jellies and icings. The goal is to clear all of the obstacles with a limited number of moves. The user will also be able to create special combos using striped candies that can clear a row or column. Each map will be manually created with a set candy placement and as the game progresses, random candies will be generated.
